eddy - Extracting Disk Dynamics
===============================

*eddy* provides a suite of tools to extract kinematical information from
spatially and spectrally resolved line data.

The :class:`eddy.rotationmap.rotationmap` class enables the fitting of a Keplerian
rotation pattern to a rotation map to infer geometrical properties of the disk,
a dynamical mass of the star, or to infer the presence of a flared emission
surface or warp in the disk.


Installation
------------

Installation is as easy as,

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install astro-eddy

If you want to live on the edge, you can clone the repository and install that,

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .

but I cannot promise everything will work as described here.
