Fitting an Annulus of Spectra
=============================

The :class:`annulus` class implemented in ``fit_annulus`` provides the
functions to derive the rotational and radial velocities from spectra extracted
from an annulus of constant radius from a disk. This implicitly makes the
assumption that the disk is predominantly azimuthally symmetric.
